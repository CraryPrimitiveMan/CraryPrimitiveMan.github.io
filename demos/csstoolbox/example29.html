      <span class='dropcap'>T</span>omorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
      creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of
      recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to
      dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a
      poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is
      heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
      signifying nothing.
