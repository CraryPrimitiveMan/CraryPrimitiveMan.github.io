<p>In computing, a <b>printer</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Peripheral" title="Peripheral">peripheral</a> which produces a <a href="/wiki/Hard_copy" title="Hard copy">hard copy</a> (permanent readable text and/or graphics) of documents stored in <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronic</a> form, usually on physical print media such as paper or transparencies. Many printers are primarily used as local peripherals, and are attached by a printer cable or, in most newer printers, a <a href="/wiki/USB" title="USB" class="mw-redirect">USB</a> cable to a computer which serves as a document source. Some printers, commonly known as <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a> printers, have built-in network interfaces, typically <a href="/wiki/Wireless_LAN" title="Wireless LAN">wireless</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Ethernet" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> based, and can serve as a hard copy device for any user on the network. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network connected users at the same time. In addition, a few modern printers can directly interface to electronic media such as <a href="/wiki/Memory_card" title="Memory card">memory cards</a>, or to image capture devices such as <a href="/wiki/Digital_camera" title="Digital camera">digital cameras</a>, <a href="/wiki/Image_scanner" title="Image scanner">scanners</a>; some printers are combined with a scanners and/or <a href="/wiki/Fax" title="Fax">fax</a> machines in a single unit, and can function as <a href="/wiki/Photocopier" title="Photocopier">photocopiers</a>. Printers that include non-printing features are sometimes called multifunction printers (MFP), multi-function devices (MFD), or all-in-one (AIO) printers. Most MFPs include printing, scanning, and copying among their features.</p>

<p>Consumer and some commercial printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround print jobs; requiring virtually no setup time to achieve a hard copy of a given document. However, printers are generally slow devices (30 pages per minute is considered fast; and many inexpensive consumer printers are far slower than that), and the cost per page is actually relatively high. However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience and project management costs being more controllable compared to an out-sourced solution. The <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a> remains the machine of choice for high-volume, professional publishing. However, as printers have improved in quality and performance, many jobs which used to be done by professional print shops are now done by users on local printers; see <a href="/wiki/Desktop_publishing" title="Desktop publishing">desktop publishing</a>. The world's first computer printer was a 19th century mechanically driven apparatus invented by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Babbage" title="Charles Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> for his Difference Engine.[1]</p>
<p>A virtual printer is a piece of computer software whose user interface and <a href="/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="Application programming interface">API</a> resemble that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical computer printer.</p>

<p>Printers are routinely classified by the technology they employ; numerous such technologies have been developed over the years. The choice of engine has a substantial effect on what jobs a printer is suitable for, as different technologies are capable of different levels of image/text quality, print speed, low cost, noise; in addition, some technologies are inappropriate for certain types of physical media, such as <a href="/wiki/Carbon_paper" title="Carbon paper">carbon paper</a> or <a href="/wiki/Transparency_(projection)" title="Transparency (projection)">transparencies</a>.</p>

<p>Another aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid <a href="/wiki/Ink" title="Ink">ink</a> such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with a liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.</p>
<p>Cheques should either be printed with liquid ink or on special cheque paper with toner anchorage.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> For similar reasons carbon film ribbons for IBM Selectric typewriters bore labels warning against using them to type negotiable instruments such as cheques. The machine-readable lower portion of a cheque, however, must be printed using <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_ink_character_recognition" title="Magnetic ink character recognition">MICR</a> toner or ink. Banks and other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on the <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_flux" title="Magnetic flux">magnetic flux</a> from these specially printed characters to function properly.</p>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Laser_printer" title="Laser printer">laser printer</a> rapidly produces high quality text and graphics. As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a <a href="/wiki/Xerography" title="Xerography">xerographic</a> printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a> beam across the printer's <a href="/wiki/Photodetector" title="Photodetector">photoreceptor</a>.</p>
<p>Another toner-based printer is the <a href="/wiki/LED_printer" title="LED printer">LED printer</a> which uses an array of <a href="/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" title="Light-emitting diode">LEDs</a> instead of a <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a> to cause toner <a href="/wiki/Adhesion" title="Adhesion">adhesion</a> to the print drum.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Inkjet_printer" title="Inkjet printer">Inkjet printers</a> operate by propelling variably-sized droplets of liquid or molten material (ink) onto almost any sized page. They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Solid_ink" title="Solid ink">Solid ink</a> printers, also known as phase-change printers, are a type of <a href="/wiki/Thermal_transfer_printer" title="Thermal transfer printer">thermal transfer printer</a>. They use solid sticks of <a href="/wiki/CMYK_color_model" title="CMYK color model">CMYK</a>-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. Solid ink printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers. Drawbacks of the technology include high <a href="/wiki/Energy_conservation" title="Energy conservation">energy consumption</a> and long warm-up times from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from <a href="/wiki/Pen" title="Pen">pens</a>, and are difficult to feed through <a href="/wiki/Automatic_document_feeder" title="Automatic document feeder">automatic document feeders</a>, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models.

<p>A <b>dye-sublimation printer</b> (or <b>dye-sub printer</b>) is a printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, paper or <a href="/wiki/Canvas_print" title="Canvas print">canvas</a>. The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels. Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text. While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.</p>

<p>The following technologies are either obsolete, or limited to special applications though most were, at one time, in widespread use.</p>
<p><b>Impact printers</b> rely on a <a href="/wiki/Force" title="Force">forcible</a> impact to transfer ink to the media, similar to the action of a <a href="/wiki/Typewriter" title="Typewriter">typewriter</a>. All but the <a href="/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer" title="Dot matrix printer">dot matrix printer</a> rely on the use of <a href="/wiki/Typesetting" title="Typesetting">formed characters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Letterform" title="Letterform">letterforms</a> that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome printing in a single typeface at one time, although <a href="/wiki/Emphasis_(typography)" title="Emphasis (typography)">bolding</a> and <a href="/wiki/Underlining" title="Underlining" class="mw-redirect">underlining</a> of text could be done by "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions in the same character position. Impact printers varieties include, typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisy wheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed, such as car rental services. <i>An overview of impact printing</i> <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.</p>

<p><b>Pen-based plotters</b> were an alternate printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based plotters rely on contact with the paper, but not impact, per se, and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images.</p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main articles: <a href="/wiki/Friden_Flexowriter" title="Friden Flexowriter">Friden Flexowriter</a> and <a href="/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter" title="IBM Selectric typewriter">IBM Selectric typewriter</a></div>
<p>Several different computer printers were simply computer-controllable versions of existing electric typewriters. The <a href="/wiki/Friden_Flexowriter" title="Friden Flexowriter">Friden Flexowriter</a> and <a href="/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter" title="IBM Selectric typewriter">IBM Selectric typewriter</a> were the most-common examples. The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known "golf ball" printing mechanism. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was pressed against the paper, printing one character at a time. The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Printer_(computing)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Teletypewriter-derived printers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Teletypewriter-derived_printers">Teletypewriter-derived printers</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Teleprinter" title="Teleprinter">Teleprinter</a></div>
<p>The common <a href="/wiki/Teleprinter" title="Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> could easily be interfaced to the computer and became very popular except for those computers manufactured by <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>. Some models used a "typebox" that was positioned, in the X- and Y-axes, by a mechanism and the selected letter form was struck by a hammer. Others used a type cylinder in a similar way as the Selectric typewriters used their type ball. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon to print the letterform. Most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although a few achieved 15 CPS.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Printer_(computing)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Daisy wheel printers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Daisy_wheel_printers">Daisy wheel printers</span></h3>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Daisy_wheel_printer" title="Daisy wheel printer">Daisy wheel printer</a></div>
<p>Daisy-wheel printers operate in much the same fashion as a <a href="/wiki/Typewriter" title="Typewriter">typewriter</a>. A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the "daisy wheel", each petal containing a letter form at its tip. The letter form strikes a ribbon of <a href="/wiki/Ink" title="Ink">ink</a>, depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character. By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing. These printers were also referred to as <i>letter-quality printers</i> because, during their heyday, they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter, though they were nowhere near the quality of <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing presses</a>. The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Printer_(computing)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Dot-matrix printers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dot-matrix_printers">Dot-matrix printers</span></h3>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer" title="Dot matrix printer">Dot matrix printer</a></div>
<p>In the general sense many printers rely on a <a href="/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrix</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pixel" title="Pixel">pixels</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Decimal_separator" title="Decimal separator">dots</a>, that together form the larger image. However, the term <a href="/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer" title="Dot matrix printer">dot matrix printer</a> is specifically used for impact printers that use a matrix of small <a href="/wiki/Pin" title="Pin">pins</a> to create precise dots. The advantage of dot-matrix over other impact printers is that they can produce <a href="/wiki/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">graphical</a> images in addition to text; however the text is generally of poorer quality than impact printers that use letterforms (<i>type</i>).</p>

</div>
<p>Dot-matrix printers can be broadly divided into two major classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ballistic wire printers (discussed in the <a href="/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer" title="Dot matrix printer">dot matrix printers</a> article)</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Stored_energy_printer" title="Stored energy printer">Stored energy printers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dot matrix printers can either be <a href="/wiki/Character_(computing)" title="Character (computing)">character</a>-based or line-based (that is, a single horizontal series of pixels across the page), referring to the configuration of the print head.</p>
<p>At one time, dot matrix printers were one of the more common types of printers used for general use, such as for home and small office use. Such printers would have either 9 or 24 pins on the print head. 24-pin print heads were able to print at a higher quality. Once the price of inkjet printers dropped to the point where they were competitive with dot matrix printers, dot matrix printers began to fall out of favor for general use.</p>
<p>Some dot matrix printers, such as the NEC P6300, can be upgraded to print in colour. This is achieved through the use of a four-colour ribbon mounted on a mechanism (provided in an upgrade kit that replaces the standard black ribbon mechanism after installation) that raises and lowers the ribbons as needed. Colour graphics are generally printed in four passes at standard resolution, thus slowing down printing considerably. As a result, colour graphics can take up to four times longer to print than standard monochrome graphics, or up to 8-16 times as long at high resolution mode.</p>
<p>Dot matrix printers are still commonly used in low-cost, low-quality applications like <a href="/wiki/Cash_register" title="Cash register">cash registers</a>, or in demanding, very high volume applications like <a href="/wiki/Invoice" title="Invoice">invoice</a> printing. The fact that they use an impact printing method allows them to be used to print multi-part documents using <a href="/wiki/Carbonless_copy_paper" title="Carbonless copy paper">carbonless copy paper</a>, like sales invoices and <a href="/wiki/Credit_card" title="Credit card">credit card</a> receipts, whereas other printing methods are unusable with paper of this type. Dot-matrix printers are now (as of 2005) rapidly being superseded even as receipt printers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Printer_(computing)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Line printers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Line_printers">Line printers</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Line_printer" title="Line printer">Line printer</a></div>
<p><b>Line printers</b>, as the name implies, print an entire line of text at a time. Three principal designs existed. In drum printers, a drum carries the entire character set of the printer repeated in each column that is to be printed. In chain printers, also known as train printers, the character set is arranged multiple times around a chain that travels horizontally past the print line. In either case, to print a line, precisely timed hammers strike against the back of the paper at the exact moment that the correct character to be printed is passing in front of the paper. The paper presses forward against a ribbon which then presses against the character form and the impression of the character form is printed onto the paper.</p>
<p>Comb printers represent the third major design. These printers were a hybrid of <a href="/wiki/Dot_matrix_printing" title="Dot matrix printing" class="mw-redirect">dot matrix printing</a> and line printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers printed a portion of a row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row could be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less motion was involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers were very fast compared to dot matrix printers and were competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics.</p>

<p>Line printers were the fastest of all impact printers and were used for bulk printing in large computer centres. They were virtually never used with <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a> and have now been replaced by high-speed <a href="/wiki/Laser_printer" title="Laser printer">laser printers</a>.</p>
<p>Line printers, better known as <a href="/wiki/Line_matrix_printer" title="Line matrix printer">line matrix printers</a> are widely used in the automotive, logistic and banking world for high speed and barcode printing. They are known as robust and durable printers that have the lowest price per page, label or other item. Companies such as <a href="/wiki/Printronix" title="Printronix">Printronix</a> and <a href="/wiki/TallyGenicom" title="TallyGenicom">TallyGenicom</a> are the leading manufacturers today. The legacy of line printers lives on in many computer <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a>, which use the abbreviations "lp", "lpr", or "LPT" to refer to printers.</p>

<li>Modern printing technology, such as <a href="/wiki/Laser_printer" title="Laser printer">laser printers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inkjet_printer" title="Inkjet printer">inkjet printers</a>, can adequately reproduce all three.

<p>Today it is common to print everything (even plain text) by sending ready bitmapped images to the printer, because it allows better control over formatting.&#160; Many <a href="/wiki/Printer_driver" title="Printer driver">printer drivers</a> do not use the text mode at all, even if the printer is capable of it.</p>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Monochrome" title="Monochrome">monochrome</a> printer can only produce an <a href="/wiki/Image" title="Image">image</a> consisting of one <a href="/wiki/Colour" title="Colour" class="mw-redirect">colour</a>, usually black. A monochrome printer may also be able to produce various tones of that color, such as a <a href="/wiki/Grayscale" title="Grayscale">grey-scale</a>. A colour printer can produce images of multiple colours. A <a href="/wiki/Photo_printer" title="Photo printer" class="mw-redirect">photo printer</a> is a colour printer that can produce images that mimic the <a href="/wiki/Gamut" title="Gamut">colour range</a> (gamut) and <a href="/wiki/Image_resolution" title="Image resolution">resolution</a> of prints made from <a href="/wiki/Photograph" title="Photograph">photographic</a> film.

<p>Often the <a href="/wiki/Freebie_marketing" title="Freebie marketing">razor and blades business model</a> is applied. That is, a company may sell a printer at cost, and make profits on the <a href="/wiki/Ink_cartridge" title="Ink cartridge">ink cartridge</a>, paper, or some other <a href="/wiki/Spare_parts" title="Spare parts" class="mw-redirect">replacement part</a>. This has caused legal disputes regarding the right of companies other than the printer manufacturer to sell <a href="/wiki/Computer_compatibility" title="Computer compatibility">compatible</a> ink cartridges. To protect their business model, several manufacturers invest heavily in developing new cartridge technology and patenting it.</p>

<p>Other manufacturers, in reaction to the challenges from using this business model, choose to make more money on printers and less on the ink, promoting the latter through their advertising campaigns. Finally, this generates two clearly different proposals: "cheap printer&#160;— expensive ink" or "expensive printer&#160;— cheap ink". Ultimately, the consumer decision depends on their reference <a href="/wiki/Interest_rate" title="Interest rate">interest rate</a> or their <a href="/wiki/Time_preference" title="Time preference">time preference</a>. From an <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">Economics</a> viewpoint, there is a clear <a href="/wiki/Trade-off" title="Trade-off">trade-off</a> between cost per copy and cost of the printer<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>The speed of early printers was measured in units of characters per second. More modern printers are measured in pages per minute. These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as <a href="/wiki/ISO/IEC_19752" title="ISO/IEC 19752">toner yields</a>. Usually pages per minute refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. PPM are most of the time referring to <a href="/wiki/ISO_216" title="ISO 216">A4 paper</a> in Europe and <a href="/wiki/Letter_(paper_size)" title="Letter (paper size)">letter</a> paper in the United States, resulting in a 5-10% difference.</p>
